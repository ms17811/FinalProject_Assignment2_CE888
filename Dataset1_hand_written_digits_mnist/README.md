Description of dataset 1:

MNIST dataset has been downloaded from the Kaggle website.

The description for the dataset is as follows

- The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.
- Hight and Width of the images are 28 pixels (pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive).
- Total 784 pixels.
- The database is consists of train and test dataset. As we are implementing the unsupervised algorithm, we used the train dataset only.
- Dataset is a labeled dataset. However, the label has been used for the evaluation purpose only (To check the performance of unsupervised deep learning algorithms).
- The training data set called train.csv, has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.
- Each pixel column in the training set has a name like pixelx, where x is an integer between 0 and 783, inclusive.



To Run the program:
- In order to the run the program download the folder along with the dataset (download the dtaset by using above-mentioned link).
- Put them inside the same directory.
- upload the "Final_Project_CE888_1804523_for_DigitMnist.ipynb" in jupyter notebook.
- run the program

Below Software are mandatory to run the program:
- Python 3+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter notebook
- Scikit learn
- All standard python libraries (ex: pandas, seaborn, numpy, scipy, and others )
