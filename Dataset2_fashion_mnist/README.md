Description of dataset 2:

MNIST fashion dataset has been downloaded from the Kaggle website. The description for the dataset is as follows

Source of description is Kaggle (Source 2)

- The data file train consists of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
- Hight and Width of the images are 28*28 (Total 784) pixels and images are gray-scale
- The database is consists of train and test dataset. As we are implementing the unsupervised algorithm, we used the train dataset only.
- Dataset is a labeled dataset. However, the label has been used for the evaluation purpose only (To check the performance of unsupervised deep learning algorithms).
- The training data set called train.csv, has 785 columns. The first column, called "label". The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of - the associated image.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

- 0 T-shirt/top
- 1 Trouser
- 2 Pullover
- 3 Dress
- 4 Coat
- 5 Sandal
- 6 Shirt
- 7 Sneaker
- 8 Bag
- 9 Ankle boot

- Each pixel column in the training set has a name like pixelx, where x is an integer between 0 and 783, inclusive.


To Run the program:
- In order to the run the program download the folder along with the dataset (download the dtaset by using above-mentioned link).
- Put them inside the same directory.
